                    M-pic is an aggregator-type web application through which a user is able to manage the photos
                    they have stored on various platforms that allow the distribution of photos (Instagram,
                    and Twitter). The application is able to take personal images from the two platforms together with
                    comments, ratings or other elements of interest about them: tags, number of shares, dimensions, etc.
                    The system provides multi-criteria search facilities. In addition, new photos can be uploaded to
                    these platforms. Graphic content can be edited within the application by applying various CSS
                    filters, defining masks or areas of interest that can be annotated with various keywords or used to
                    crop areas of images that can be used in photo collages. or in making various CSS animations.
                    The images, together with the processing performed on them, can be made available publicly
                    (or privately) through a REST / GraphQL web service.
